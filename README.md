             Project: E-LearnX – E-Learning Platform UI:

Objective:

E-LearnX is a multi-page front-end interface designed for an interactive e-learning experience. It includes course listing, video embedding, and progress tracking using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


              Structure:

index.html – Lists all available courses

course.html – Plays selected course videos with progress tracking

style.css – Common styling for both pages


Course Listing Page (index.html):

Features a gradient-styled header with branding and navigation.

Displays courses like HTML & CSS Basics, JavaScript Essentials, and React Fundamentals in responsive cards.

Each card has a title, description, and “Start Learning” button that links to the course viewer page dynamically via query strings.


Course Viewer Page (course.html):

Dynamically loads the course title and embeds a YouTube video based on the course query parameter.

Includes a JavaScript-powered animated progress bar that increases to 100%, enhancing user interactivity.

Styling Highlights:

Uses CSS variables (--gradient, --dark, --light) for a modern theme.

Responsive layout built with CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Clean UI with hover effects for better engagement on all screen sizes.

JavaScript Logic:

URLSearchParams fetches the selected course from the URL.

Dynamically sets course content and embeds video.

Progress bar uses setInterval() to simulate video progress visually.

          Outcome:

A fully responsive and interactive front-end project showcasing essential web development skills. Ideal for real-world LMS integration or as a portfolio project for aspiring developers.
